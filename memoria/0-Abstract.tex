\chapter*{Abstract}

Deep learning has rised by drastic improvements over reigning approaches towards the hardest problems in Artificial intelligence (AI), massive investments from industry giants, and exponential growth in research publications. Deep learning is a tool inside the machine learning toolbox, the goal is to make machines learn.

In some areas of artifical vision, deep learning techniques have been very succesful, howeve, in the field of visual tracking  are not yet mature, therefore we have developed the multiple people tracking algorithm with deep learning techniques. Thus, in this work we have designed and build a software component that combines tracking by detection, using deep learning techniques, with feature tracking, using the Lucas-Kanade method. Combining these techniques, we make use of their advantages and reducing the effect of their drawbacks. In addition, the software component, utilize a mechanism of person reidentification.

Finally, the software component, has been validated experimentally and tested on a well-known database, Multiple object tracking dataset.
